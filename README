README for procps package
=========================

COMPATIBILITY

    This code is intended for use with Linux 2.0.xx and above.
    Both libc 5 and libc 6 should work.

PS/TOP WCHAN FIELD

    In past releases, in order to get WCHAN output for ps, you had to
    have a psdatabase for each zImage kernel that you generated from
    the vmlinux unstripped binary with /sbin/psupdate.  With this release,
    you should use the System.map automatically generated by Linus' makefile.
    'ps' and 'top' will first use the contents of an environment variable
    "PS_SYSTEM_MAP" and then look for System.map files along
    the followin search path:
        /boot/System.map-V, /boot/System.map, /lib/modules/V/System.map,
    Here 'V' is the output of "uname -r" and looks like "2.2.0".
    Don't forget the dash! In those same locations, remove psdatabase* files.
