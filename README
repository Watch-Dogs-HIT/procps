COMPATIBILITY

    This code is intended for use with Linux 2.0.xx and above.
    Both libc 5 and libc 6 should work.

INSTALLATION

    make
    make install

    If you wish to test before installing, use the scripts
    named t, v, and p to ensure the correct libproc
    is used during your testing.

    In case the fancy stuff gives you trouble, you may
    use the previous Makefile: make -f Makefile.noam

BUG REPORTS

    Debian users should use the Debian bug tracking system.
    Email to albert@users.sf.net or csmall@debian.org or
    procps-feedback@lists.sf.net will also work.
